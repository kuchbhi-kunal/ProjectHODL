            <h1>Namaste!</h1>
            <p>Lately, many of us have been curious about the investment world, professionally, but also on a personal
                level.
                And there has been a boost in investments since the Wuhan Virus pandemic. But while people are learning
                about investing, portfolio theory,
                Scholes formula, Arbitrage and all the complex investment and finance stuff, this knowledge is useless
                unless you have a few lacs in the bank.
                Most of what we learn about is not accessible for personal investing.</p>
            <p>So I had to find other ways to put my capital to work. I started exploring investment options in 2019,
                options that i could
                access with limited capital. Now, I regularly have friends asking me for investment advice. And i always
                tell them the
                same thing: I am not an expert, I can only point a few directions that worked for me, you can explore
                them
                by yourself.
                I won't advise anyone on what company to invest in, what stock to pick or whether it's ok for you in
                particular to bet 2 grand in crypto.</p>
            </br>
            <h1>Is it a CRIME to make money?</h1>
            <p>Our society looks down on people who have wealth. Wehen someone asks our salary, the question stems from
                a
                sense of JUDGEMENT.
                We value people based on how much money they make. It make it difficult for both kinds of people: the
                ones
                who are well off as well
                as those who are barely making money to be honest about their finances. As a result- Money Has Become A
                Taboo.
            </p>
            <p>Nobody is honest about it.
                </br>
                Nobody knows what to do.
            </p>
            <p style="color:rgb(26, 113, 212);">Repeat after me- it is okay to take home a good amount of wealth.</br>
                Repeat after me- it is okay to struggle with money.</p>
